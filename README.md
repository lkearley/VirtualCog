# Alzheimer's Speech Analysis Application for iOS

The goal of this Alzheimer’s Speech Analysis app is to help physicians and clinicians alike to better diagnose a patient with Alzheimer’s and their memory capabilities. In order to accomplish this, three tests (Multilingual Naming Test, Picture Scan, and Face-Name Recall) are performed with the physician and patient and recorded, then uploaded to Box, to better understand how the patient’s memory is working in regards to remembering images or recalling faces or names that are presented to them.
